## Exercies 3: Numbers and Math

This exercise has lots of math symbols. Let's name them right away so you know what they are called.
As you type this one in, say the name. When saying them feels boring you can stop saying them. Here
are the names:

| symbol |        name        |
| :----: | :----------------: |
|  `+`   |        plus        |
|  `-`   |       minus        |
|  `/`   |       slash        |
|  `*`   |      asterisk      |
|  `%`   |      percent       |
|  `<`   |     less-than      |
|  `>`   |    greater-than    |
|  `<=`  |  less-than-equal   |
|  `>=`  | greater-than-equal |

## Exercies 10: What Was That?

### Escape Sequences

This is all of the escape sequences Ruby supports. You may not use many of these, but memorize their
format and what they do anyway.

| **Escape** |                  **What it does**                   |
