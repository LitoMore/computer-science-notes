### 1.1 Painting and Drawing

An image that is presented on the computer screen is made up of ***pixels***.

Most screens these days use 24-bit color, where a color can be specified by three 8-bit numbers,
giving the levels of red, green, and blue in the color.

Other formats are possible, such as [***greyscale***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale),
where each pixel is some shade of gray and the pixel color is given by one number that specifies
the level of gray on a black-to-white scale.

Early computer screens used [***indexed color***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_color),
where only a small set of colors, usually 16 or 256, could be displayed.
