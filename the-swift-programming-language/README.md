### About Swift

Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adoping modern programming
patterns:

- Variables are always initialized before use
- Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors
- Integers are checked for overflow
- Optionals ensure that `nil` values are handled explicitly
- Memory is managed automatically
- Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures
